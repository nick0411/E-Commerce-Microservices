# E-Commerce-Microservices
This project is an intermediate-level microservices system demonstrating real-world backend architecture using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Spring Cloud, and JWT authentication.  Each microservice is fully isolated with its own database, communicates through REST + Kafka events, and registers with a Eureka discovery server.
